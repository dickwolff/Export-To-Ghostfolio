## How to use

You can run the tool on your local machine by cloning this repository. You can also run the tool inside a Docker container. See the runtime specific instructions below.

## Docker

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/dickwolff/export-to-ghostfolio?style=for-the-badge)](https://hub.docker.com/r/dickwolff/export-to-ghostfolio)

<details>
<summary>View instructions</summary>

### System requirements

To run the Docker container you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine. The image is published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dickwolff/export-to-ghostfolio).

### How to use with the Dockerhub image

Contrary to the locally run version of the tool, the containerized version tries to determine which file type to process by looking to the header line inside the file. So there is no need to specify which converter to use.

You can then run the image like:

```console
docker run --rm -v {local_in-folder}:/var/tmp/e2g-input -v {local_out_folder}:/var/tmp/e2g-output --env GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_ID=xxxxxxx dickwolff/export-to-ghostfolio
```

The following parameters can be given to the Docker run command.

| Command | Optional | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `-v {local_in-folder}:/var/tmp/e2g-input` | N | The input folder where you put the files to be processed |
| `-v {local_out_folder}:/var/tmp/e2g-output` | N | The output folder where the Ghostfolio import JSON will be placed. Also the input file will be moved here when an error ocurred while processing the file. |
| `-v {local_cache_folder}:/var/tmp/e2g-cache` | Y | The folder where Yahoo Finance symbols will be cached  |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_ID=xxxxxxx` | N | Your Ghostolio account ID [^1] |
| `--env USE_POLLING=true` | Y | When set to true, the container will continously look for new files to process and the container will not stop. |
| `--env DEBUG_LOGGING=true` | Y | When set to true, the container will show logs in more detail, useful for error tracing. |
| `--env PURGE_CACHE=true` | Y | When set to true, the file cache will be purged on start. |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_VALIDATE=true` | Y | When set to true, the tool with automatically validate the generated file against Ghostfolio. |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_IMPORT=true` | Y | When set to true, the tool will try to automatically import the generated file into Ghostfolio. |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_URL=http://xxxxxxx` | Y | The endpoint of your **local** Ghostfolio instance. E.g. `http://192.168.1.15:3333`. **Use ONLY with a local Ghostfolio instance!** |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_SECRET=xxxxxxx` | Y | The credentials of your Ghostfolio user. Used to authenticate with the `import` API endpoint. **Use ONLY with a local Ghostfolio instance!** |

[^1]: You can retrieve your Ghostfolio account ID by going to Accounts > Edit for your account and copying the Account ID field 

![image](assets/account_settings.png)

### How to use by generating your own image

Use this option if you wish to run using an isolated docker environment where you have full control over the image and thus can trust it to contain only what is expected.

Clone this repository to your system and then run:

```console
docker build -t export-to-ghostfolio .
docker run --rm -v {local_in-folder}:/var/tmp/e2g-input -v {local_out_folder}:/var/tmp/e2g-output --env GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_ID=xxxxxxx -t export-to-ghostfolio
```

You can use the same options as above for using the image on Dockerhub

### Caching

The tool uses `cacache` to store data retrieved from Yahoo Finance inside the container. This way the load on Yahoo Finance is reduced and the tool should run faster. The cached data is stored inside the container in `/var/tmp/e2g-cache`. If you feel you need to invalidate your cache, you can do so by adding `--env PURGE_CACHE=true` to your run command. This will clear the cache on container start, and the tool will recreate the cache the next time it has to retrieve data from Yahoo Finance.

## Run locally

<details>
<summary>View instructions</summary>

### System requirements

The tool requires you to install the latest LTS version of Node, which you can download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The tool can run on any OS on which you can install Node.

### Use the tool

Next, clone the repo to your local machine and open with your editor of choice (e.g. Visual Studio Code).

Run `npm install` to install all required packages.

The repository contains a sample `.env` file. Rename this from `.env.sample`.

- Put your export file path in the `INPUT_FILE` variable. This has to be relative to the root of the project.
- Put the Ghostfolio account name where you want your transactions to end up at in `GHOSTFOLIO_ACCOUNT_ID` 
  - This can be retrieved by going to Accounts > select your account and copying the ID from the URL 
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5620002/203353840-f5db7323-fb2f-4f4f-befc-e4e340466a74.png)
- Optionally you can set the `GHOSTFOLIO_UPDATE_CASH` variable to `TRUE` to automatically update your Ghostfolio account cash balance after processing the activities.
- Optionally you can enable debug logging by setting the `DEBUG_LOGGING` variable to `TRUE`.

You can now run `npm run start [exporttype]`. See the table with run commands below. The tool will open your export and will convert this. It retrieves the symbols that are supported with YAHOO Finance (e.g. for European stocks like `ASML`, it will retrieve `ASML.AS` by the corresponding ISIN).

| Exporter      | Run command                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Bitvavo       | `run start bitvavo` (or `bv`)       |
| BUX           | `run start bux`                     |
| DEGIRO        | `run start degiro`                  |
| eToro         | `run start etoro`                   |
| Finpension    | `run start finpension` (or `fp`)    |
| Freetrade     | `run start freetrade`  (or `ft`)    |
| IBKR          | `run start ibkr`                    |
| Investimental | `run start investimental`           |
| Rabobank      | `run start rabobank`                |
| Schwab        | `run start schwab`                  |
| Swissquote    | `run start swissquote` (or `sq`)    |
| Trading 212   | `run start trading212` (or `t212`)  |
| XTB           | `run start xtb`                     |

### Caching

The tool uses `cacache` to store data retrieved from Yahoo Finance on disk. This way the load on Yahoo Finance is reduced and the tool should run faster. The cached data is stored in `/var/tmp/e2g-cache`. If you feel you need to invalidate your cache, you can do so by removing the folder and the tool will recreate the cache when you run it the next time.

</details>

## Import to Ghostfolio

### Manually

The export file can now be imported in Ghostfolio by going to Portfolio > Activities and pressing the 3 dots at the top right of the table. Since Ghostfolio 1.221.0, you can now preview the import and validate the data has been converted correctly. When it is to your satisfaction, press import to add the activities to your portfolio.

### Automatically (experimental)

There is an experimental feature (since 0.12.0) with which you can automatically validate and import the generated file into Ghostfolio! To use this, set the corresponding environment variables:
| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_VALIDATE=true` | When set to true, the tool with automatically validate the generated file against Ghostfolio. |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_IMPORT=true` | When set to true, the tool will try to automatically import the generated file into Ghostfolio. |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_URL=http://xxxxxxx` | The endpoint of your **local** Ghostfolio instance. E.g. `http://192.168.1.15:3333`. **Use ONLY with a local Ghostfolio instance!** |
| `--env GHOSTFOLIO_SECRET=xxxxxxx` | The credentials of your Ghostfolio user. Used to authenticate with the `import` API endpoint. **Use ONLY with a local Ghostfolio instance!** |

## Contributing

We welcome any contribution to the repository. Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/dickwolff/Export-To-Ghostfolio/issues/new) or, even better, build it yourself and create a [pull request](https://github.com/dickwolff/Export-To-Ghostfolio/compare)!

The tool can be run two ways, manually and via Docker. Both entrypoints of the tool can be found in the ‘src/‘ folder. 
The tool uses a mock in the tests, which allow the tests to be run in a consistent and repeatable manner. This way there is no necessity for a live Yahoo Finance service. The mock was added because of inconsistencies in between test runs and rate-limiting issues with Yahoo Finance (with multiple consequetive runs, especially when running locally).

Whenever you add a new converter or create a fix for an existing one, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/dickwolff/Export-To-Ghostfolio/wiki/Add-new-testdata-to-Yahoo-Finance-mock) for instructions on how to extend the mock with testdata.
